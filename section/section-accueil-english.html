<h3>Welcome to my personal website.</h3>
<p>
    I started to take an interest in web programming done by my predecessors at my job, in SQL queries and functions
    Excel specials since 2013, thanks to my former colleague Xavier.<br><br>

    In the fall of 2015, I decided to take my first steps at university and chose UQAM.
    Since I started this adventure, I do it part-time, because I work full-time.<br>

    I started with the « Certificate in Telecommunications Networks and Systems » and as soon as I
    first lesson, web programming fascinated me even more, and so I decided to buy a domain name.<br><br>

    After getting my domain name, I started taking the « HTML & CSS » course on the excellent OpenClassrooms site.
    <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3" target="_blank">
        HTML/CSS course website</a> to practice and start making a semblance of a website, but after a few weeks,
    for lack of time, I put everything aside until the fall of 2017...<br><br>

    I decided to transfer in the winter of 2017 to the « Certificate in Computer Science and Software Development », because I
    started to like programming more and more. It was with my Web Programming I course, that I really realized that
    I loved web programming, so I quickly started redesigning my site to make it what you still see today,
    improving aspects of the site.

    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>JavaScript / JQUERY</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the fall of 2019, I started my 2nd certificate, « Advanced Certificate in Software Development » and decided to do a
    baccalaureate by accumulation.<br><br>

    However, during the fall 2022 semester, I decided to transfer all my courses to the real bachelor's degree in computer science, i.e.
    « Bachelor of Computer Science and Software Engineering ». In the winter of 2023, I will begin the last third of my studies.

    If you have any suggestions for web projects, I'm interested.<br><br>

    Since late fall 2017, I have taken over the management of our home web servers at my job to do maintenance and improvements by creating
    tools. I consider myself a web programmer at my job (a few hours a week) which is in the field of telecommunications.
