<h3>Welcome to my personal website.</h3>
<p>
    J'ai commencé à m'intéresser à la programmation web fait par mes prédécesseurs à mon travail, aux requêtes SQL et aux fonctions
    spéciales d'Excel depuis 2013, grâce à mon ancien collègue de travail Xavier.<br><br>

    In the fall of 2015, I decided to take my first steps at university and decided to choose UQAM. To undertake this
    adventure, I will be part-time since I am full-time at my job.<br>

    I started with the « Certificate in Telecommunications Networks and Systems (4888) » and as soon as I
    first class, I became interested in web programming, and so I decided to buy a domain name.<br><br>

    With my domain name, I started taking the “HTML & CSS” course on the excellent OpenClassrooms site.
    <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3" target="_blank">
        HTML/CSS course website
    </a> to practice and start making a semblance of a website, but after a few weeks, due to lack of time, I put it all aside
    until fall 2017...<br><br>

    Then I decided to transfer in the winter of 2017 to the "Certificate in Computer Science and Software Development (4702)", because I
    started to like programming more and more. It was with my Web Programming I course, that I really realized that
    I loved web programming, so I quickly started redesigning my site to make it what you still see today,
    improving aspects of the site.

<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>JavaScript / JQUERY</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the fall of 2019, I started my 2nd certificate, "Advanced Certificate in Software Development (4626)" and did a bachelor's degree
    by accumulation.<br><br>

    However, during the fall 2022 semester, I decided to transfer everything to the real bachelor's degree in computer science, i.e.
    « Bachelor of Computer Science and Software Engineering (7316) ». In the winter of 2023, I will begin the last third of my studies.

    If you have any suggestions for web projects, I'm interested.<br><br>

    Since late fall 2017, I have taken over the management of our home web servers at my job to do maintenance and
    improvements by creating tools. I consider myself a web programmer at my job (a few hours a week) which is in the field of
    telecommunications.
