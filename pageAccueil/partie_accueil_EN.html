        <h3>Welcome on my personnal web site.</h3>
        <p>
            In the fall of 2015, I became interested in web programming and decided to buy a domain name. At the same time, I undertook a first certificate at the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM).<br><br>	
            Parallel to my certificate start
            <a target="_blank" href="https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3">The web site of course HTML/CSS</a> I started to follow the course of «HTML & CSS» on the excellent site Openclassroom, but after a few weeks, for lack of time, I put all that aside until the autumn 2017, where with my short Web I programming, I decided to start revitalizing my website based on the knowledge I was acquiring during the session.        
            <br><br>
            My site evolved during the session with the learning of these languages, compared to its origin of November 2015 :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>	
            At somewhere in the beginning of 2018, I will begin learning these frameworks mentioned below. For now, I continue to understand the workings of CSS and JavaScript.
            <br><br>
            Over time, I will create other projects based on my current inspirations and my knowledge of web programming and mastery in a not too distant future of Framework like :
        </p>	
        <ul>
            <li>JQuery (January 2018)</li>
            <li>Semantic-Ui (CSS)</li>		
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you have any suggestions for web projects, I will be always interested.
            <br><br>
            I even have the chance to test my skills as a junior web programmer at my job (a few hours a week) which is in the field of telecommunications.
